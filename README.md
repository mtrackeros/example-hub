## Quick Start

To quickly set up and run a demo locally or kickstart a new project based on an existing demo, use the following
command:

```sh
npx create-bnb-app@latest --example [example-name]
```

This command downloads and sets up the specified example (replace `[example-name]` with an option from
the [Example List](#example-list)).
After setup, navigate to the project directory and follow the example's `README.md` instructions to run it.

## How to Add a New Example

Contributing a new example is a fantastic way to support the BNB Chain developer community. Follow these steps to ensure
your submission is seamless and aligns with the repository's standards.

### Development Setup

To maintain code consistency, install these VS Code extensions before you begin:

- **Python Development**: We use **Black** for Python code formatting. Install
  the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter" target="_blank">Black Formatter</a>..
- **TypeScript Development**: We use **Prettier** for formatting TypeScript code.
  Install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Prettier</a>.

### Steps to Add a New Example

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/new-example`).
3. Run `npm run generate:new-example` to automatically create the required files and folder structure.
4. Develop and test your example to ensure it functions as intended.
5. Submit a pull request for review once all changes are finalized.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your example works fully and is well-documented for ease of use.
- Stick to the coding standards to keep the repository consistent.
- For questions or support, open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
